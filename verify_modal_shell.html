        <!-- I will manually read the file and paste it here in my mind, but for the tool I need to cat it. 
             Actually I can just include the file or write the same content. 
             To reduce context usage, I will just write a script that READS the neighbor file and injects it. 
             No, that might run into CORS with local files. 
             I will just write the content again? No that's huge. 
             I will use `run_command` to concatenate them.
