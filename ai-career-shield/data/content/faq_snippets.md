## FAQ: Is any job 100% safe from AI?

No. The goal isn’t to find an “AI‑proof” job — it’s to build a more resilient career.

AI tends to automate parts of jobs first, then changes the market around the job (competition, expectations, budgets). Roles are usually more resilient when they involve physical presence, real‑time judgment, trust/accountability, and high‑context human interaction.

We focus on what’s exposed in your workflow — and what to strengthen next.

## “This Week” template: Physical / service roles (e.g., hairdressers)

1) Set reality constraints early: add a line to your consultation: “AI reference images can be unrealistic — we’ll translate the vibe into what’s physically possible.”
2) Build a “possible examples” library: 15–30 real photos of achievable outcomes by hair type/length.
3) Create a 3‑question intake: hair type, maintenance tolerance, “must keep” constraints.
4) Offer a Plan B: if the reference is impossible, propose 2 alternatives (closest vibe + best for their hair).
5) Document outcomes: take before/after shots (with permission) to build trust and reduce unrealistic expectations.
