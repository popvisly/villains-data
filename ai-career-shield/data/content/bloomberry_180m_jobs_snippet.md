## What this is
A blog analysis by Henley Wing Chiu claiming analysis of ~180M global job postings (Jan 2023–Oct 2025) using Revealera data, focusing on which normalized job titles grew/declined most in 2025 vs 2024.

**Important caveat:** Job postings ≠ hires. Results can be influenced by macro conditions, title taxonomy choices, regional mix, and "ghost jobs".

## Calm-advisor takeaways (5)

1) **Baseline matters:** overall postings declined ~8% in 2025 vs 2024. Individual titles should be compared against that baseline.
2) **Creative work is bifurcating:** the article reports declines in some *execution* creative roles (e.g., computer graphic artists, photographers, writers), while *strategic/lead* creative roles are more resilient.
3) **Not all declines are AI-driven:** compliance/sustainability declines are attributed to policy/regulatory shifts rather than automation.
4) **AI infra roles are growing:** ML engineering and adjacent infrastructure roles (robotics, applied research, data centers) are reported as growing.
5) **Customer support hasn’t collapsed uniformly:** the article argues many support workflows still need judgment/empathy beyond chatbots.

## How AI Career Shield uses this (non-hype)
- As **context** for market signals and factor explanations.
- Not as a deterministic predictor of any individual’s future.

## Mapping to Role Library (examples)
- AI Production Strategist → creative leadership/ops direction
- Agent Orchestrator → agent workflows + reliability
- Automation Analyst → ops automation + measurable outcomes
- Data Steward → data quality/governance for AI readiness
- AI Enablement Specialist → adoption + training + safe usage
