    "summary": "OP used multiple AI models to rank careers/majors by automation risk + salary; asks whether it matches what people see in their industry.",
    "raw": "I used 9 AI models to rank 52 career paths (starting from undergrad majors) on salary/recession-proofing, AI survival (AI augments vs replaces; physical/empathy/licensing moats), and burnout vs pay. The models agreed that medicine and advanced nursing are safest; skilled trades and some engineering rank high; generic CS and non-CPA accounting are riskier; marketing/communications and junior creative work are hit hard. 'AI/Data Science undergrad' was rated risky because the field changes fast and tools automate parts of it. Does this match what you're seeing, and how should someone actually choose a path from this?"
