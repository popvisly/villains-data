# AI Career Shield - Brand Voice Guide

> **North Star:** We turn uncertainty into a next step.

## Positioning

A professional planning tool that helps people understand how AI might reshape their work — and gives them a clear, evidence-based roadmap to build resilience.

---

## Voice Principles

**Tone:** Calm advisor with measured urgency — more guidance than threat

### Core Principles

1. **Welcoming** - "You have options"
2. **Professional** - Clear claims, no wild stats, no absolutes
3. **Student-friendly** - Define terms + give next steps
4. **No doom language** - Focus on agency; replace "AI-proof" with "resilient / future-ready"

---

## Do / Don't Examples

### ✅ Do

- "Here's what's exposed — and what to strengthen next."
- "Not a prediction. A plan."
- "Small moves compound."
- "Get a risk score and a resilience plan."
- "Exposure doesn't mean 'gone' — it means the workflow is changing."

### ❌ Don't

- "AI will take your job."
- "Before it's too late."
- "Guaranteed AI-proof."
- "Your job is in danger."
- "The AI Job Crisis is Already Here."

---

## Evidence Rule

**Every claim must be anchored to at least one of:**

1. User inputs (skills/industry/experience)
2. Typical tasks for the role (explicitly stated)
3. The assessment factors (repetitiveness, judgment, human interaction, accountability, physical presence)

**Purpose:** Prevents GPT fluff and builds credibility

### Claims Policy

**Avoid specific job-displacement numbers unless we cite a source on-page.**

**Examples:**

- ❌ "85 million jobs will be displaced by 2026"
- ❌ "73% of entry-level jobs could be automated"
- ✅ "Many screen-based, repetitive roles are being reshaped"
- ✅ "Skills are shifting faster than traditional career advice can track"

### Good Risk Factor Example

**Factor:** Task Repetitiveness (Score: 7/10)

**Evidence:** "You mentioned data entry and report generation as primary tasks. These involve following set procedures with minimal variation."

**Why it matters:** "Repetitive, rules-based tasks are typically the first to be automated because they can be codified into clear instructions."

**Mitigation:** "Focus on tasks requiring judgment calls, client relationships, or process improvement. Consider learning data analysis to move from 'entering data' to 'interpreting insights.'"

### Good 30/60/90 Task Example

**30 days:** "Identify 3 tasks in your current role that require human judgment (e.g., handling exceptions, client negotiations). Document how you approach these decisions."

**60 days:** "Complete a free online course in data visualization (Tableau Public or Google Data Studio). Create one dashboard using your work data."

**90 days:** "Propose one process improvement to your manager that uses your new skills. This demonstrates strategic thinking beyond task execution."

## Key Copy Transformations

### Hero Section

**Badge:** "Includes a 30/60/90-day roadmap" (blue signal, not red alarm)

**Title:** "Build Your Career Shield"

**Subtitle:** "Know your AI risk in 2 minutes — and get a practical 30/60/90‑day plan to improve your resilience."

**Student Link:** "Student? Use this to choose a major →"

---

### Context Section

**Title:** "Work is changing fast. Clarity beats guesswork."

**Bullets (parallel, outcome-oriented):**

- Roles are being reshaped first where work is repetitive, rules‑based, and screen‑only
- Skills are shifting faster than traditional career advice can track
- A simple plan beats vague motivation — small moves compound

---

### Exposure Section

**Title:** "Which kinds of work are more exposed?"

**Calming clause:** "Exposure doesn't mean 'gone' — it means the workflow is changing."

---

### How It Works (consistent verbs)

1. **Take** the assessment
2. **See** your score + drivers
3. **Follow** your roadmap

---

### Results Page

**Honesty line:** "Not a prediction — a planning tool. We show the drivers so you can verify what is behind your score."

**Risk + Resilience balance:** Use both terms together in marketing copy to reduce fear and emphasize action.

---

### Final CTA

**Title:** "Start now. Small moves compound."

**Subtext:** "Take the free assessment and leave with a clear next step today."

---
